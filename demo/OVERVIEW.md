## ðŸ§¾ Project Overview

### ðŸŽ¯ Project Name  
**Cyphers Bank Web Application**

### ðŸš€ Summary  
Cyphers Bank is a secure, responsive banking prototype built using Java Spring Boot, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a dual-PIN transaction system designed for both everyday use and emergency scenarios. The application demonstrates how modern web technologies can be combined with backend logic to deliver intuitive, safety-conscious financial services.

### âœ¨ Key Features  
- Responsive landing page with mobile-friendly navigation  
- Secure login validation using hardcoded credentials  
- Dual-PIN transaction system:
  - **Daily PIN** for regular transactions  
  - **Emergency PIN** for transactions that trigger an SMS alert to a third-party security company or SAPS  
- Dynamic footer with JavaScript-generated date  
- Spring Boot controller handling routing, authentication, and PIN logic

### ðŸ’¡ Inspiration  
The project was inspired by the need for enhanced personal safety in digital banking environments. By introducing an emergency PIN that silently alerts authorities or security partners, Cyphers Bank aims to provide users with peace of mind during high-risk situations while maintaining full transactional functionality.

### ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements  
- Replace hardcoded credentials and PINs with encrypted, database-driven authentication  
- Integrate SMS gateway APIs (e.g., Twilio or Clickatell) for real-time emergency alerts  
- Add biometric login and multi-factor authentication  
- Implement user dashboards with transaction history and account management  
- Deploy to cloud platforms with CI/CD pipelines  
- Add audit logging and role-based access control for enterprise readiness
